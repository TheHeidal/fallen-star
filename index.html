                        <li>You can move as fast as falling rain, as fast as a hawk, as fast as a battlecry.</li>
                        <li>You are as tall and broad as three men put together, and have the hunger of an army.
                        </li>
                        <li>An extra pair of arms burst from your shoulders, strong enough to lift mountains.</li>
                        <li>Your face contorts to resemble a war-mask, with fearsome eyes and tusks jutting from
                            your
                            lips.
                        </li>
                        <li>You can smell blood better than a hound, and you can smell in someone's sweat their fear
                            and
                            hate.
                        </li>
                        <li>A flaming ring burns above your head, which shines brighter in your anger and fury.</li>
                        <li>Your blood is blue, and scalding for any who touch it.</li>
                        <li>Armor grows from your skin, scales and plate etched with tales of your exploits.</li>
                        <li>Multiple pairs of iron wings extend from your back, sharp enough to cut skin and strong
                            enough
                            to
                            carry you through the air.</li>
                        <li>When you rage your breath transforms into flames, and you may breathe fire the way a
                            dragon
                            might.
                        </li>
                        <li>A long barbed tail juts from your back, prehensile and dripping poison. </li>
                        <li>Your teeth are sharpened to points and your tongue lolls from your mouth like a dog.
                        </li>

                            air,

                            sounds
                            of drums and horns at your steps, to motivate your troops or dismay others.</li>
