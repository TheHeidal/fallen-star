    The Book of Thrones
    The Warlock's Codex of the Seven-Part Pact
    Draft 3.24.9.2 (September 2024)



    Part I: The Warlock
    Behold the Warlock, known as the Keeper of the Throne, Blade-Bearer, and the Furious Lord of Lords. He is the
    oath-sworn Wizard of the Ishanian King, who acts on behalf of the crown of Isha to ensure the stability of power
    across the archipelago. He is oft of an honorable and harsh temperament, and he is governed by the planet Mars and
    the metal Iron. It is said the first Warlock was the King's oath-bound court Wizard, and the love shared between the
    two was only marred by their vicious betrayal. He is the only Wizard of the Seven-Part Pact empowered to commit
    violence against an errant wizard, and thus he is known as the Pact's Executioner.
    Within this Part of The Book of Thrones, you will be prompted with a number of choices to make on behalf of your
    Wizard. Should your answers ever change, or your Wizard grow beyond your original image of him, your Elements should
    change as well.
    Humour & Temperament
    The four Elements govern your relationship with magic, and these Elements are governed by your relationship with the
    world. Mark down which path best describes you, and increase the corresponding Elemental Circle.
    One of the many noble clans of Isha claims you as a member of their family. Were you your father's favorite child
    (+1 Earth) or the black sheep of the family (+1 Air)?
    As a member of the nobility, it is expected for you to possess tremendous wealth. Are you frugal and austere (+1
    Earth) or do you spend lavishly on that which appeals to you (+1 Water)?
    You are a warrior on behalf of the King, and have thus fought in battle. Within your own mind, are you a chivalrous
    hero and adventurer (+1 Water) or a brutal executioner (+1 Air)?
    The King commands you to murder an innocent woman, who begs for your mercy. Do you save her life and hide her away
    (+1 Water) or follow his commands despite your misgivings (+1 Fire)?
    You serve two masters, and are caught between your loyalties. Which do you value more: the King (+1 Air) or the Pact
    (+1 Fire)?
    You have killed a man before. When you close your eyes and remember, do you feel proud (+1 Fire) or guilty (+1
    Earth)?
    Your fragment of the Seven-Part Pact is a blade, but in your hands it may take another form:
    A regal broadsword, engraved with an oath of power, which may burst into flames at your will. (+1 Fire)
    A shining longbow, carved with glorious depictions of warriors past, and always nocked with an arrow. (+1 Air)
    A cruel ax, heavy with blood and executions past, which no man but you may lift. (+1 Earth)
    Twin cutlasses, one white as bone and the other black as night, well-versed in naval combat. (+1 Water)
    You have a familiar who accompanies you in your magic, and who accompanies you when you charge into battle. They
    are:
    A glorious stallion, with iron hooves and a flowing mane. (+1 Fire)
    A powerful hawk, with violent talons and a piercing call. (+1 Air)
    A growling mastiff, with dull eyes and drooling jaws. (+1 Earth)
    A playful ermine, with beautiful fur and tiny sharp teeth (+1 Water)
    (Or another animal, who provides +1 to an Element of your choice)
    History & Secrets
    There was another Wizard before you, your old master who taught you the practice of malison, and in many ways was a
    father for you. How did he teach you, and what became of him? Choose 1 which is known to all and 1 which you harbor
    in secret.
    He was a popular and gregarious noble, who knew how to inspire largesse in all who knew him, including you. He
    passed away choking on a bone during a feast, or some similar uneventful and unremarkable death.
    He was the last of an older kind of hero, a chivalrous knight who raised you on stories of adventure and codes of
    honor. He was killed by a wild boar during a hunting expedition, a great tragedy that all of Isha mourned.
    He was a monstrous tyrant, finding pleasure from the misery of others, and who taught you both to inflict violence
    on others and to suffer it. He died while fighting against one of the great foes of the Pact, or perhaps another
    Wizard.
    He was a greedy craven coward, who played Isha's politics to maintain his authority, and who taught you the violence
    of lies and manipulation. You killed him yourself, and it brought you no small pleasure to do so.
    He was the hound of his betters, and served both the king and the Pact with obedient fury, teaching you to do the
    same. He died the way all violent dogs do — someone had to finally put him down.
    You never met the former Warlock, as you were chosen by the King and the Pact working together to fill a vacant
    seat. You learned much from the agony of trying to fill his shoes.
    You learned your magic amid the politics and tutors of the court, and you have the scars to prove it. You needed no
    master to teach you the art of violence.
    The one scarcity all Wizards share is time. Wizards discuss their age in scores, periods of twenty years that shape
    their long and wizened lives. How old are you, and what is expected of you in your age?
    You are just a boy, far too young to assume the mantle of Warlock, but the sudden death of your old master and the
    demands of the King forced you to take on power beyond your years.
    You are a young fellow, not yet two scores old, and it is expected for you to already be betrothed to another
    noble's daughter, and for you to have engaged in your first duel.
    You are of a middling age, between two and three scores old, and you are expected to be married, and to have
    fathered at least one child.
    You are of a proper age, between three and four scores old, and you are expected to have led a campaign of war, and
    to have taken many lives.
    You are of a great age, between four and five scores old, and you are expected to be the patriarch of your clan, and
    to be among the oldest and wisest within court.
    You are at least a century old, older than the king, and it is expected for you to be dead by now, and everyone at
    court is waiting hungrily for your passing.
    You are far more than a century old, older than entire dynasties of Isha's rule, and you have become part of the
    architecture of the court, a single constant amid a sea of chaos.
    Magic changes those who work with it. Choose 1 change, and another 1 for every score you've been alive:
    You can move as fast as falling rain, as fast as a hawk, as fast as a battlecry.
    You are as tall and broad as three men put together, and have the hunger of an army.
    An extra pair of arms burst from your shoulders, strong enough to lift mountains.
    Your face contorts to resemble a war-mask, with fearsome eyes and tusks jutting from your lips.
    You can smell blood better than a hound, and you can smell in someone's sweat their fear and hate.
    A flaming ring burns above your head, which shines brighter in your anger and fury.
    Your blood is blue, and scalding for any who touch it.
    Armor grows from your skin, scales and plate etched with tales of your exploits.
    Multiple pairs of iron wings extend from your back, sharp enough to cut skin and strong enough to carry you through
    the air.
    When you rage your breath transforms into flames, and you may breathe fire the way a dragon might.
    A long barbed tail juts from your back, prehensile and dripping poison.
    Your teeth are sharpened to points and your tongue lolls from your mouth like a dog.
    You crave the taste of human flesh.
    You are a man, as all Wizards are. However within your heart you know:
    To be a man is to be a leader and dominate over others, and you are always at the beck and call of your master.
    To be a man is to be a chivalrous hero, and yet this world has no more room for heroes, and chivalry is an easy way
    to a pathetic death.
    Some deep-set part of you is repulsed by your maleness, and so you double down into a crueler and harsher version of
    masculinity.
    There is some part of you which is kind and caring and distinctly feminine, but you must guard that part of your
    heart from the violence of your job, and only show it to those closest to you.
    You were once a woman, but you had no choice but to kill that part of you, and reject the weakness of femininity in
    order to serve the King.
    No one dares speculate on your manhood. You would kill the next person to make such a claim in front of you.
    There is an even greater secret, which is for you and you alone.
    Your name as a Wizard within the Seven-Part Pact is:
    A name taken from military history or from a great king of the past.
    A title bestowed upon you by the King himself.
    An honorific earned from your exploits in battle.
    A nickname picked up in the halls of the court.
    Might & Trappings
    Through your Pact-Fragment, you may freely perform any of the following:
    When casting a spell directly against an unwilling foe, or when casting any spell during Combat (as discussed during
    Part IV), consult an additional die.
    Interpret the presence of "⊖" (Salt) as "♂" (Mars).
    Murder any mortal who stands before you with a single strike of your Pact-Fragment, faster than they can react and
    with such certainty that none may dispute their death.
    Along with your Pact-Fragment, you possess 3 of the following Treasures. Pick which ones you inherited from your old
    master, which were gifted to you by the King for your service, and which you won in combat:
    Armor forged from old mage-steel, scavenged up from beneath the seas, and strong enough to withstand any blow from a
    mundane weapon.
    A shield bearing a perfectly mirrored surface, and reflecting certain lesser magics back at those who seek you harm.
    A pair of greaves bearing feathery wings, such that when you strike them against the ground by your will, they lift
    you up into the air at a tremendous speed.
    A full set of chess pieces, who when commanded, will transform into soldiers and fight at your side until sunrise.
    An iron ring used in ancient days by torturers and soldiers amidst the Tragedies. Whoever wears it cannot die from
    any wound.
    One of the last dragon's eggs, rare beyond measure and warm to the touch.
    A beautiful locket on a delicate chain, the sort carried by soldiers on a long campaign, with enough room for a
    portrait of someone you long for.
    Additionally, you are adept at the secret practices of malison, which grant you access to certain Humble Magics,
    cantrips which you may perform at any time through your will and without any incantation. They include:
    Perform a daring feat of physical athleticism which dazzles others' senses, leap into the air, or lift heavy stones
    which no one else could lift.
    Roar with a thunderous voice, or carry your voice across a battlefield, or act with the sounds of drums and horns at
    your steps, to motivate your troops or dismay others.
    Place both hands upon someone's shoulders, and in an instant divine whether they are an eligible heir for the
    bloodline of Isha's royalty.
    Finally, you carry the following possessions:
    A red silk robe, with iron clasps bearing the symbol of Mars.
    Three sets of clothes, at least: suitable for a wealthy nobleman, a general commanding an army, or a simple servant
    incognito amongst the court.
    Any materials necessary for the casting of magic, such as: arrowheads, golden coins, flowers, etc.
    Any accessibility aids or mobility tools, such as: glasses, a cane, painkillers, etc.
    This very Codex, filled with the notes of Warlocks past.
    Part II: The Keep & Its Companions
    In the monumental fortress of the past the Warlock schemes, surrounded by those few useful enough to keep his
    company. It is a cutthroat and bitter life, here at the head of Isha, but it is the seat of power for the Furious
    Lord of Lords, and all know to watch their backs when they visit his home.
    Within this Part of The Book of Thrones, you will be prompted with a number of choices to make about your Wizard's
    Isle, Sanctum, and Companions. Many of these choices are not immediate, and if you intend to stay with this Warlock
    for a long period of time, you may wait until you have a free moment (or until the story of the Pact calls upon such
    knowledge).
    The Keep Within The Halcyon Isles
    The Halcyon Isles are the traditional seat of power in Isha, all surrounding the King's castle. Change or add one
    detail from its Lore, if you would like. You may Spend Time to care for the Halcyon Isles, and in doing so, change
    or add to its Lore further.
    The Halcyon Isles are a beautiful and serene place, with rolling hills, sprawling gardens, and groves of
    carefully-tended trees tucked away amid its towering cliffs.
    The Castle of the King looks over the Halcyon Isles, an enormous structure of great hewn stone and bearing countless
    towers and parapets overlooking the southern seas.
    It is rumored the palace was built by giants, for the doorways are far too large for any man and the stairs had to
    be carved anew. Generations of kings have further added to the castle, with incongruous and spectacular new wings.
    Every noble clan maintains an estate somewhere in the Halcyon Isles, and those nearest to the Castle connect to it
    via narrow stone bridges high above the rocks.
    The Halcyon Isles require incredible amounts of produce and manpower from the rest of the archipelago in order to
    maintain the hedonistic lifestyle of the nobles who dwell there.
    The Warlock's Keep is a small castle built across a narrow strait from the palace of the King, and serves as your
    private Sanctum from the outside world. Change or add one detail from its Lore, if you would like. You may Spend
    Time to care for your Sanctum, and in doing so, change or add to its Lore further.
    The keep of the Warlock is musty and minimalist, maintained by servants too afraid to move anything that could be
    valuable.
    The keep is enormous and uncomfortable, with ceilings too tall for any human and doorways made for giants.
    The keep is covered in tapestries and trophies of wars long forgotten, surrounding you with your own inadequacy.
    A bridge runs from the palace directly to your sleeping chambers, allowing the King to fetch you at his whims.
    Traps prepared by paranoid Warlocks previous to you litter the lower floors and walls, and you must tread carefully,
    lest you accidentally set one of them off.
    A Map of the Halcyon Isles
    Whenever you have a spare moment, complete and mark the map of the Halcyon Isles. It should include some or all of
    the following details:
    The Warlock's Keep.
    The part of the palace the King currently dwells in.
    The older abandoned parts of the palace.
    The estates of the various powerful clans.
    The barrack and servants' quarters, hidden from view.
    Where the powerful go to relax in public.
    Where the cunning go to scheme in secret.










    Companions & Care
    While you are a Wizard, you are also mortal, and as a mortal, you require care from others to survive. These are
    your four Areas of Care, and each is associated with a particular Element.
    Your daily life, ensuring your quarters are kept clean, your vestments are prepared, and only the finest foods will
    touch your plate. (Earth)
    Your emotional life, comforting you when your thoughts turn violent, keeping your bed warm each night, and washing
    your scars with herbal baths. (Water)
    Your private life, guarding your keep from spies and assassins, concealing your emotions from the outside world, and
    ensuring your secrets never leave this room. (Air)
    Your creative life, providing conversation late into the night, practice with both strategy and physical skill, and
    stimulating conversation on the nature of power. (Fire)
    The higher your Elemental Circle is, the more important and valued that Companion's Care will be. Choose four
    Companions, with at least 1 Companion who shares your Keep with you and at least 1 who prefers the comforts of the
    palace, and assign each an area of Care.
    Your prentice, who must serve as Warlock when you die.
    Your wife, an arranged marriage from an allied clan.
    Your child, naive to the violence of power.
    Your sibling, who tends to the affairs of your family estates.
    Your lover, who doesn't care about your scars or your titles.
    Your tutor, who trained you in matters of the court.
    Your soldiers, who are willing to die by your command.
    Your ancestor, whose spirit watches over your lineage.
    You may Spend Time with one of your Companions to gain +1 in their associated Elemental Circle. You may also, during
    a Scene, ask of them any favor, and they will comply if they are able to, and ask something of you in return.
    Should one of your Companions ever depart, die, or become unwilling to provide their Care, you must do so yourself.
    Each month you must Spend Time fulfilling or handling the missing Care, often in a sloppy, self-destructive, or
    vice-filled way. If you don't, the associated Elemental Circle is reduced to zero this month.
    Developing Your Companions
    Whenever you have a spare moment, develop more about your Companions by answering questions about them, exploring
    their inner lives further.
    Your Prentice
    How did you find your Prentice? What is his name?
    What lie have you told your Prentice about his origins?
    Who else from the court is trying to manipulate your Prentice? or How must you indoctrinate your Prentice into the
    warrior's life?
    Your Wife
    How did you meet your wife? What is her name?
    What secrets does your wife understand which you cannot grasp?
    When did the two of you learn to work together as a team? or What political ambitions does she still vie for?
    Your Child
    Which gender do you know your child is? What is his or her name?
    What is it about politics which your child is still unaware of?
    Why is your child not your prentice, despite their wishes? or Where does your child go, when they sneak away at
    night?
    Your Sibling
    Is your sibling older or younger than you? What is their name?
    Why wasn't your sibling chosen to be Warlock instead of you?
    What power does your sibling possess amid the politics of Isha? or What have you helped your sibling achieve, which
    they could never have gotten on their own?
    Your Lover
    How do first impressions often deceive your lover's nature? What is their name?
    What gift does their presence give you which no one else can provide?
    How do the two of you express your affection for one another? or Why must your relationship stay secret from the
    King?
    Your Tutor
    What has age taken from your tutor? What do you call them?
    What did your tutor teach you that your parents never would?
    Which part of them is just as vivid as it was in her youth? or What secret would your tutor never teach you?
    Your Soldiers
    How do you train your soldiers? What do you call them?
    What vice do your soldiers indulge in above all else?
    Who have your soldiers killed for you? or What other power do your soldiers serve?
    Your Ancestor
    When did your ancestor die? What is their name now?
    Why is your ancestor disappointed in you?
    What secrets does your ancestor teach you? or Under what oath is your ancestor bound?
    Part III: The Court of the King
    The King of Isha sits upon a sturdy throne at the heart of his bustling court, full of politicians and generals,
    heirs and traitors, all squabbling and bickering over their part of the great coffers of power. To rule over Isha is
    to find agreement between a thousand conflicting interests, to consolidate countless factions into a single mighty
    force. You ought not to envy the King, although you may be grateful that he has you to aid him in his plans.
    Within this Part of The Book of Thrones, you will be prompted to establish the Laws of the Court and the personality
    of the King of Isha, along with the rough sketches of those who fill his court. This Part will also walk through the
    rules for maintaining the Court, adding new Servants to its ranks, and executing the will of those Servants once
    they catch the ear of the King.
    Entering The Court
    The King of Isha
    Within the walls of the palace, the stars and planets orbit only around the King of Isha, the Halcyon King, the
    Divine Regent of the Immortal Flames, Most Wise, and the Summer Lord of a Thousand Isles. Determine his sun, moon
    and rising by completing the following sentences.
    Sun Sign — The King outwardly appears to be…
    Moon Sign — The King is secretly…
    Rising Sign — The King wishes he was…
    Aries — A righteous warrior or an argumentative fool.
    Taurus — A sturdy commander or a stubborn bastard.
    Gemini — A beloved diplomat or a two-faced spymaster.
    Cancer — A romantic lover or a weepy crybaby.
    Leo — A legendary hero or an arrogant braggart.
    Virgo — A nurturing father or a scrupulous penny-pincher.
    Libra — A prudent philosopher or a cowardly people-pleaser.
    Scorpio — A brilliant artist or a manipulative rat.
    Sagittarius — A noble champion or a furious tyrant.
    Capricorn — A dependable guardian or a miserable melancholic.
    Aquarius — A scholarly genius or a pseudointellectual windbag.
    Pisces — An amateur Wizard in his own right or a delusional madman.
    The King's name may be of any style you think is appropriate, and is frequently followed by a number. A King is
    given a new name upon his ascent to the throne, to align him in history with his predecessors. Kings never have
    surnames — it is unbecoming to have to claim authority through association.
    Palace Politics

    This is a model of the King's Court, showing his opinion of those who serve him. His Servants (including you) all
    Stand somewhere in his estimation, although his opinions are mercurial at best, and will frequently adjust where
    each of his Servants Stands. Proximity to the Inner Circle (His Love, His Guide, His Friend, and His Heir) takes
    Time and effort, and if one isn't careful it's easy to slide off the Court and to be dismissed from his presence.
    The Laws of the Palace depend upon the whims and desires of the King, and failure to follow them will result in a
    reduction of Standing at best, or exile or imprisonment at worst:
    One may not speak to the king without being spoken to.
    One must always speak kindly of the King and agree with him, no matter how absurd his statements.
    One must always be dressed in elaborate silks, gowns, armors, and other decorative elements which can take many
    hours to adorn.
    One must follow elaborate rules of etiquette while eating and dining, the subtleties of which require extensive
    training.
    One must gift lavishly and excessively to all other nobility they encounter.
    One must always keep one's murders secret, for it's considered tasteless to kill another.
    One must never speak the name of the previous king within the palace.
    Power in Isha is consolidated amongst the Clans, noble houses who each command and tithe different areas of the
    archipelago. To learn more of their secrets, consult The Noble Clans starting on page XX.
    The Croft Clan, who lay claim to most of the arable land in Isha, and control farming, shepherding, and most other
    parts of rural Isha's economy.
    The Uroch Clan, who are responsible for creating many of Isha's great works of art, and control the royal quarries,
    the order of stonemasons, and the lapidary association.
    The Lark Clan, who profit off of Isha's bountiful oceans, and control the fisheries, wet markets, and the drowned
    towers of Old Isha.
    The Caravel Clan, who long ago mastered the holy art of ship-building, and control the sacred shipwright houses,
    their timber groves, and their secrets.
    The Oshrani Clan, who wield a chokehold over Isha's ports, and control the markets and tariffs of Isha, the five
    banking halls, and the merchant guilds.
    The Wain Clan, who ferry the dead and dying out to the Graven Isle, and control the black freight, the surgeon
    guilds, and (in secret) the import of illegal magic and goods from Scuttleport.
    The Ix Clan, who safeguard Isha's secret liturgical writing systems, and control Isha's scriptorium, the vellum
    drovers, and the lesser universities.
    Rules of the Court

    Summary of the Court
    Each Servant occupies a Standing within the King's Court. Each Standing only has room for one Servant. If someone is
    moved forward, then someone else is pushed further away from the King.
    The four Standings closest to the King (Love, Friend, Guide, and Heir) are his Inner Circle.
    A Servant's Agenda is determined by their Authority. Whenever a Servent implements their Agenda, it changes Isha.
    If you're in the Inner Circle, you may use your Agenda as well, to Impact Isha. If you're in the King's Inner
    Circle, you must Spend Time each month to maintain your Standing.
    You may Spend Time to move any Servant to an adjacent Standing, or if someone is at the Risky Standings (Harlot,
    Traitor, Worthless, Disgrace), to remove them from the Court.
    Each month, consult the Stars in alignment with the King's Sun, Moon, and Rising signs.
    Mercury: Determines who the King pushes forward or pushes away.
    Venus: Determines which member of the Inner Circle's Agenda occurs.
    Mars: Determines who the King advances from within the Court.
    Jupiter: Determines who from outside joins the Court.
    Saturn: Determines the state of violence within the Court.
    The Sun: Determines the King's regal performance.


    Authorities & Allegiances
    Every member of the Court is composed of two parts: their Authority and their Allegiance. Their Authority is an
    appointment granted to them by the King, liable to be stripped away at any moment, and determines how they wield
    power over Isha when they occupy the King's Inner Circle. Their Allegiance determines whose interests they serve and
    protect when they do wield power.
    Each Servant's Authority and Allegiance, along with their Agenda, is tracked on their Authority Card, which can be
    found starting on page XX. You can give these Servants more information by answering the questions in Part IV:
    Keeper of the Throne on page XX when you have a spare moment.
    New Servants will frequently join the Court. Choose whichever Authority and Allegiance makes the most fictional
    sense, and consult with the rest of the Celestial Audience for advice. The easy choice is always the Ascendant
    Allegiance.
    Agendas in the Court
    The position of the stars determine which Servant's Agenda occurs each month. Agendas are powerful ways to Impact
    Isha, and can produce enormous changes to the Domains of other Wizards — for good or for ill.
    When a Servant's Agenda occurs, look at their Authority Card and choose one of their Agendas. Try to choose the
    Agenda that will be most interesting as the Celestial Audience, rather than the choice which benefits you as the
    Warlock. This Agenda may Impact other Domains, add new Servants to the Court, rework the Court dramatically, or
    cause the death of an important character. Frequently the Agenda will favor that Servant's Allegiance.
    Standing In The Court
    The Court is composed of 20 Standings, which determine each Servant's stance in the eyes of the King. Those closest
    to the King (His Love, His Friend, His Guide, and His Heir) are his Inner Circle. The four immediate outside the
    Inner Circle (His Courtesan, His Confidant, His Ward, and His Hound) represent those he values but who he doesn't
    fully trust. The eight beyond that, in the outskirts of the Court, are those the King finds irritating or unpleasant
    in this moment. The final four (Harlot, Traitor, Worthless, and Disgrace) are the Risky Standings, and those in them
    are most at risk of being disposed of, through the risk provided by the Standing.
    When a Servant moves into a Standing which already possesses a Servant, the old Servant is forced to move to a
    further Standing. This will often cause more Servants to be pushed further back. If a Servant is forced to move
    back, and they're already in a Risky Standing, then they will be disposed of.
    If you're in the King's Inner Circle, you must Spend Time to stay in his good graces. If you don't, at the end of
    the month, move backwards in his Standing. If you're at a Risky Standing, you must similarly Spend Time to maintain
    your position. If you don't, you'll be Disposed of. While the Warlock's disposal is rare, if it occurs, work with
    the Gate-Keeper to determine if and how you survive. If you do manage to live, consult page XX for how to proceed
    when the Warlock is not trusted by the King.
    Dueling, Charming, and Disposal
    Gentlemanly Dueling
    When two men at court wish to prove their power over one another, or for some reason one feels wronged by the other,
    they may choose to Duel. These Duels are often (although not always) non-lethal, focused instead on proving
    authority and demonstrating mastery. Only men can be challenged to Duels.
    When two Servants Duel, ask the Celestial Audience who would win. The winner moves forward in the King's Standing,
    while the loser moves back in Standing.
    Charming
    Seduction, both literal and more metaphorical, occurs constantly at Court, and everyone's loyalties can be quite
    mercurial. When a Servant charms another Servant, change the Charmed Servant's Allegiance to match the charmer. If a
    Servant Charms another Servant of the same Allegiance, instead:
    The two Servants have sex. Perhaps they have a baby.
    The two Servants run away together. Remove them from the Court.
    The two Servants conspire to kill another Servant. Dispose of an enemy Servant.
    Disposal
    If a Servant is at a Risky Standing, and is pushed further back, they are Disposed of. This will be different based
    on which corner of the Court they were removed from.
    If the Servant is Assassinated or Executed, they're dead. Discuss with the Gate-Keeper who killed them.
    If the Servant is Imprisoned or Exiled, they may still be alive. Set them aside, and add them to the Court when a
    new King takes power.
    If the Warlock (or any other Wizard) would be disposed of, instead ask the Gate-Keeper for when a Wizard is dying,
    or consult the rules for When The Warlock Does Not Stand Within The Court on page XX.
    Spending Time At Court
    There are spies everywhere within the palace, and manipulating the webs of gossip is just as valuable a skill as
    martial prowess to survive within the court. You may Spend Time to whisper in the King's ear and move any other
    Servant one Standing forward or backwards in the King's estimation. If someone is at a Risky Standing, you may Spend
    Time to Dispose of them.
    You may also Spend Time to Charm any Servant of the Court, or Duel any man in the Court.

    List of Authority Cards
    As Warlock, you are an Authority as well. Your card is on page XX.
    There are two kinds of Authority, divided by how they achieve and maintain their power. First are Social
    Authorities. These are Authorities whose power is granted from fondness or fascination on the part of the King.
    A Mistress, who sleeps with the King and pleasures him. May also be called a concubine, catamite, or a betrothed. On
    page XX.
    A Bard, who entertains the King through performance, japes, and artistry. May also be called a painter, a fool, or a
    poet. On page XX.
    A Knight, who fights on behalf of the King and keeps him company. May also be called a knight, a bachelor, or the
    master of the hunt. On page XX.
    An Advisor, who whispers advice and wisdom to the King. May also be called a doctor, a chaplain, or a vizier. On
    page XX.
    A Mercenary, who protects the King and their Allegiance. On page XX.
    Certain Social Authorities are central to the operation of the palace, and represent the King's immediate household.
    The Queen, whose loyalty determines the Ascendent Allegiance. On page XX.
    A Prince, who is a son of the King (by blood, adoption, or trade). On page XX.
    A Princess, who is the daughter of the King (by same, or by marriage). On page XX.
    The second category are Political Authorities. These are the Authorities whose power is granted via an official
    appointment from the King.
    The Viceroy, who may also be called a secretary, an emissary, or the hand of the king. They represent the King in
    foreign affairs. On page XX.
    The Treasurer, who may also be called a steward, a chamberlain, or a seneschal. They take care of the King's
    treasury and the Royal Mint. On page XX.
    The Governor of a specific Isle, who rules over that Isle as a representative of the King. There may only be one
    Governor per Isle. On page XX.
    A Dignitary from a foreign power or powerful clan, who represents them at court. There may only be one Dignitary per
    Foreign Power. On page XX.
    Certain Political Authorities only wield power at the Court if a specific Wizard is also present at the table. While
    you may still choose to include these Authorities during play, their Agenda may be limited.
    The Champion of the King, only if a Necromancer is present, on page XX.
    The Pontifex of the Royal Faith, only if a Hierophant is present, on page XX.
    The Admiral of the Royal Fleet, only if a Mariner is present, on page XX.
    The Constable of the King's Guard, only if a Faustian is present, on page XX.
    The Chronicler of the King's History, only if a Sorcerer is present, on page XX.
    The Oracle of the King's Future, only if an Anchorite is present, on page XX.
    If there are multiple Political Authorities, they may share duties but possess different Titles, drawing on the list
    of Alternate Titles on their Authority Card.

    Part IV: Keeper of the Throne
    While you play the Warlock, there is also a second role which you must fulfill, in your part as Throne-Keeper of the
    Celestial Audience. Through the Celestial Audience, you will represent the ceaseless violence of the world, the
    brutality in the hearts of men and the great machines of war, and ensure that when blood is spilled, Wizards pay
    their dues. Wizards are men, and as men we must all carry the seeds of anti-life within our hearts — someone must
    remind them of this fact.
    Within this Part of The Book of Thrones, you will learn your responsibilities as a member of the Celestial Audience
    and the unique rules governing your own domain, that of warfare and politics, and the violence which underpins them.
    These will provide you with tools to engage with scenes even when your character isn't present.
    All Wizards Are Men
    All Wizards Are Men, indeed, all Wizards know this. In your part as the Celestial Audience, you are the guardian of
    this truth, who provides its implications as they play out across the world of Isha.
    Maleness and power are intertwined. To successfully be a powerful man is to be a member of an exclusive club, where
    women are eager to please and other men vie for your attention. Everyone benefits from this hierarchy, as long as
    they're willing to play by the rules. A noblewoman can call upon her husband or father to protect her from the
    common folk, and in that act of violence she too benefits from that consolidation of power (as long as that woman
    never challenges or undermines his own authority in any way).
    Manhood is enforced through internal and external pressure. There are a tremendous number of expectations tied to
    masculinity; expectations of abledness, virility, heterosexuality, confidence, and domination. Failure to live up to
    these expectations results in social rejection and hostility, while embracing masculinity is lionized and virtuous.
    Proving that you're good at being a man means other men will respect you and the women in your life will trust that
    they can depend on you to protect them. No one will doubt your right to rule if only you're man enough.
    Masculinity is performed and asserted through violence. If people start doubting your masculine authority, your grip
    on power is threatened. The only way to prove (to yourself, to others, to the world) that you're a real man is
    through dominating those weaker than you. The greater the threat of emasculation and powerlessness, the more
    pressure you face to commit acts of violence that prove your authority. Even if a woman joined the Pact, she would
    still need to prove herself within this system through cruelty and domination, and the cycle of power would continue
    unabated.
    You make the final call. Within the Celestial Audience, you rule absolutely on all matters of your Domain. If there
    is any uncertainty around the mechanisms of violence or expectations of masculinity from any member of the Pact, you
    make the final decision. If you feel ill-equipped or too biased to make that decision, you may deputize another
    member of the Celestial Audience to decide for you. When men lay blows against one another to prove their power, you
    can consult the Rules for Combat on page XX.
    During Other Scenes
    When you're operating as part of the Celestial Audience, keep an eye out for the following:
    Ways in which Wizards negatively Impact the King, his Court, the noble Clans, or other powerful institutions in
    Isha. Represent this through the adding or adjusting of Servants to the Court, changing Allegiances, or in rare
    cases, utilize the Rules for War.
    Opportunities to remind the Pact that All Wizards are Men, and to invoke the Rules For Combat.
    Space to enforce the hierarchy of power that dominates Ishanian life, expectations of masculinity pushed upon the
    wizards, and the way patriarchy warps the archipelago.
    Rules For Combat
    Once more, the blade is drawn. Once more, blood must flow. No matter what, we find ourselves here again.
    Combat can take many forms, from simple duels to messy brawls to large scale battles. Combats are composed of
    Combatants, individuals or groups who act together. Each Combatant is armed with Assets, a short list of weapons,
    armaments, defenses, incantations, and skills that are relevant for the Combat at hand.
    Combat proceeds back and forth, exchanging The Initiative — a token bearing a crown on it, and the measure of who is
    leading the fight, and who is following behind. Skilled Combatants are those who can make elegant and creative use
    of their Assets, and who can stay on their toes and keep their focus. A fight is a lot like a dance, and the first
    to stumble will most likely fall.
    Observing Combat
    The Throne-Keeper, and any other members of the Celestial Audience not present in the Combat, have the vital
    responsibility of observing the fight and adjudicating on what is or isn't permissible. Throughout every fight,
    Combatants will be taking various actions, strikes, parries, and responses, and if at any moment any member of the
    Celestial Audience finds one's behavior to be implausible, they must speak up and challenge this act. Everyone must
    remember their duties to the believability of the world of Isha and the story of the Pact. While Combat favors those
    with quick wits, it should be won by those who can ground their actions in believability and previously-established
    truth.
    While a Map isn't necessary, it can be helpful for the Celestial Audience to follow along with the events of the
    fight, especially if they're not participating. Draw a representation of the battlefield, and represent each
    Combatant with a token placed somewhere on the map. Adjust the tokens as the fight continues on, and use their
    placement to make decisions about the plausibility of various strikes and parries. For large-scale battles, where a
    Combatant may have Assets composed of platoons of troops and armadas of ships, instead represent each Asset as its
    own token on the Map.
    Preparing Assets
    At the start of every Combat, for each Combatant, the player speaking for that Combatant prepares a list of Assets
    available by answering the following questions about how prepared their Combatant is and what tools they possess.
    What weapons do you possess? (Each weapon is a separate Asset)
    Are you wearing any armor or wielding a shield? (Armor is collectively a single Asset)
    Do you have any Treasures on your person? (Each Treasure is a separate Asset)
    Do you have any magical abilities or know any humble magic? (Each magic is a separate Asset)
    Are you accompanied by any beasts or lesser servants? (Each is considered their own Asset)
    Do you have any training or relevant skills? (If so, your training is an Asset)
    Can you wield the landscape here to your advantage? (If so, that familiarity is an Asset)
    Are the winds, the seas, or any higher power present on your side? (If so, this power is an Asset)
    Do you feel excited or dedicated to this fight ? (If so, your excitement or dedication is an Asset)
    Dueling
    A duel between two honorable warriors is the model of violence, from which all other forms are descended. It is a
    shame, then, how rare they are. When a Duel is to begin, both sides prepare their list of Assets, and the initiator
    of the Duel seizes the Initiative. The wielder of the Initiative then takes an action, which is responded to by the
    opposing Combatant. Both duelists go back and forth in this manner, until one is unable to respond.
    If you possess the Initiative, you may choose from the following actions…
    Say: "I strike at you with [an Asset], which will [inflict Violence]." You must justify how this Asset commits
    violence. The opposing Combatant must now respond.
    Say: "In a decisive blow, I use [an Asset] to destroy [an opposing Asset]." You must justify how that Asset may be
    used to so thoroughly destroy the opposing Asset. They lose this Asset, but that opposing Combatant gain the
    Initiative.
    Say: "I step back and gather my strength." You pass the Initiative, but create a new Asset, repair a lost Asset,
    cast a spell, or Flee. If you've taken this action three times in a row, you must Flee.
    Say: "I don't know." You must pass the Initiative.
    If you don't possess the Initiative, you may choose from the following responses…
    Respond with: "I parry your strike with [an Asset]." You must justify how this Asset allows you to avoid or ignore
    the blow. Your opponent retains the Initiative.
    Respond with: "I take this blow, accepting your violence, but I strike back." You suffer the injury and pain
    inflicted by their strike, as many Assets as they can justify you lose, but you seize the Initiative. If the
    violence is enough to Incapacitate you, you must become Incapacitated.
    Respond with: "I don't know." and suffer the pain and injury of the strike, destroying as many Assets as they please
    and most likely Incapacitating you. In a fight with multiple Combatants, they then pass the Initiative.
    Casting Magic
    As Wizards, we frequently resort to magic during Combat. Magic isn't quick, however — when one casts a spell, they
    must step back and pass the Initiative. Record the results of the spell, and treat them as Assets to be utilized. A
    single spell can create multiple Assets in this fashion. When you use a Spell in this way, some of its properties
    may be hindered by the opposing Combatant's Wards, if they have any. Once you regain the Initiative, you may use the
    spell, and if they have no method to defend against such magical attacks, then they'll have no appropriate response.
    If a maledictive spell is described as occurring especially quickly, or faster than someone may respond, you
    immediately regain the Initiative after casting it, as the opposing Combatants simply cannot respond in time.
    Fleeing a Fight
    When someone has the Initiative, they may attempt to Flee a Combat. When they do so, they describe by what method
    you Flee (through magic, through a Treasure, through their own two legs, etc.) and whether they have any Assets
    which make their escape easier. The opposing Combatant may in turn justify which of their Assets could be used to
    impede the escape. The Celestial Audience decides whether the escape was a success. If it was, the fleeing Combatant
    is no longer present. If it wasn't, instead the fleeing Combatant loses one of their relevant Assets and the
    opposing Combatant seizes the Initiative.
    Incapacitation and Loss
    An Incapacitated Combatant is entirely at the mercy of the winning Combatant. They may choose to take the loser
    prisoner, maim the loser in some fashion, humiliate them, kill them, or let them go. If they would die, this
    encounter is no longer your responsibility — ask the Gate-Keeper what happens next.
    Multiple Combatants
    Fights with multiple Combatants function similarly to Duels, but with certain elements worth addressing.
    When one passes the Initiative (by stepping back or hesitating), they must pass it to whoever has been waiting the
    longest for their turn to act. When an Asset is destroyed with a decisive blow, the Initiative passes to the
    Combatant whose Asset was destroyed. Combatants who both lack the Initiative and lack any chance to respond can be
    assumed to be circling around the edge of the fight, licking their wounds and angling for a good attack. The Combat
    isn't over until all standing Combatants agree it has concluded, at which point they collectively decide what to do
    with the Incapacitated Combatants.
    If a Wizard is fighting against a squad of soldiers or another group of less-powerful Combatants, it can make sense
    to group those warriors together into one Combatant. If you do, choose one from below to best describe them:
    They are a small and skilled team. (Add an Asset for each team member and their skill)
    They are a gang of less than 20. (Add the Asset: "We're able to work together and coordinate.")
    They are an enormous mob. (Add the Assets: "Although we are many, we act as one." and "There are a limitless number
    of us.")
    Other Forms Of Combat
    There are forms of Combat which lie beyond these rules. Certain dinner parties between powerful nobles, contests of
    mental will in the realm of Dreams, and academic debates within the University may all be, on occasion, more
    accurately described as a form of Combat should the Celestial Audience deem it so. In these cases, determine Assets
    as you feel is appropriate, reflecting the unique circumstances of the fight.
    Rules For War
    Lords and ladies love to pretend that war will be quick and easy. The truth is that war is a messy affair, a state
    of volatility fought on many fronts, that ripples outwards throughout the world. While a battle may be modeled in
    the movement of troops and heroes, war is instead represented through volatility and chaos. Once a war begins, those
    who lead it are only somewhat in control of its motions, and war may continue to rage even without the support of
    its commanders. Wars aren't just fought with men, but with economies, propaganda, and in some cases, even dreams.
    Fronts
    When War begins, choose which member of the Celestial Audience will be representing each Side. As the Throne-Keeper,
    it is customary that you represent Isha itself. The attacking Side places down three Fronts to begin onto any other
    Wizard's Domain, a token representing a locus of contention and a site of wrestled control. Every different Domain
    with at least one Front present is said to be In Turmoil.
    Any Wizard's Sanctum or Isle, or the Orrery itself, representing a literal war being waged within their home.
    The Seas and Isles of the Mariner are locations of physical battles fought with troops, or strategic maneuvers to
    seize resources from those areas. Most Fronts of traditional Wars between nations will be placed here.
    Each Rank of the Temples of the Hierophant are a facet of Isha's economy and culture. (Notor is the port and trade,
    Zephon is farming and agriculture, Krolis is artisan craftworks, Hestar is for knowledge and faith)
    The Court Standings of the Warlock represent shadow battles and exchanges of political power within Isha.
    Each of the Communities of the Faustian are for the hearts and minds of the various Ishanian social classes.
    The Sorcerer's Books are historical events and perspectives on past events in Isha.
    The Gates of the Necromancer and the Sorcerer's Dreams can only be chosen and fought over by sides with some kind of
    access to those other realms. They may still possess Fronts, when Isha clashes with supernatural armies or when
    Wizards go to war against each other, but this is not the norm. Any other Lore in a Wizard's Codex may also possess
    a Front, which could represent an ideological battle or a far-away conflict in the furthest hells.
    Each month, every Front creates a Complication associated with its placement for their Wizard.
    Applying Force
    During the Planning Moon of each month, each Side participating in a War gains a certain amount of Force. Force
    represents the amount of (military, financial, social, magical, etc.) pressure your Side can apply to Fronts.
    Everyone representing a Side secretly places their Force:
    You can place any amount of Force on a Front, as you apply pressure there.
    You can spend four Force on an otherwise calm Domain to make that Domain In Turmoil and place a Front within it.
    You can spend two Force on any Domain In Turmoil, to create a new Front there.
    You can spend Force to leverage a foreign power, mercenary company, or other neutral party to lend aid. Two Force
    spent will ensure financial aid, providing an additional one Force for the next three months. Four Force spent will
    ensure soldiers and reinforcements, providing an additional three Force for the next three months.
    Cancel out opposing Force on Fronts one-to-one, leaving any excess Force on that Front. If a Side has at least two
    more Force than anyone else on that Front, they gain control of it, and may do one of the following:
    Push the Front to an adjacent space within that Domain. If there are two Fronts in the same space, they merge into
    one Front.
    If the Front at the edge of the Domain (one of the Near Gates of Death, a Rank I within a Temple, the Risky
    Standings in the Court, the Horizon Line of the Mariner's Map, or any space in the Faustian, Librarian, or Sorcerer
    Domains), remove the Front entirely.
    Remove the Front, claim control of the area the Front occupies and create a Bastion there for your Side, or destroy
    a Bastion present there.
    Bastions
    A Bastion for a side represents their ability to control that portion of a Wizard's Domain. This can be a literal
    fortress or battalion, or it can be a more metaphorical embargo or cult of personality, depending on the Domain. A
    Wizard must Spend an extra week of Time whenever they want to interact with the controlled portion of their Domain.
    The Bastion contributes an extra two Force to any other Fronts in the same Domain as it.
    Bastions can only be removed if a Front is moved over them and then won, or if the Bastion's controller willing lets
    go of control.
    War Comes To Isha
    Rallying Armies
    The armies of Isha are a diverse coalition of various forces, mustered together by a shared loyalty to the King.
    Each Allegiance is willing to contribute one Force if they have a Servant in the King's Court, and another two Force
    if they have a Servant in the King's Inner Circle.
    In the event of a civil war, or one in which Clans turn against the King, each traitorous Allegiance can contribute
    up to three Force to the Side if they're contributing manpower, or one Force if they're only contributing
    financially.
    If a foreign nation invades Isha, the amount of Force they can contribute each month depends on the amount of effort
    they're able to invest. The attackers get three Force, gaining an additional two Force for every active Front. If
    they're receiving ten or more Force, then this qualifies as a massive invasion of Isha. Every month a foreign power
    utilizes ten or more Force from their home, change their Lore to reflect the strain of this attack upon their
    economy.
    Suing For Peace
    Not all war ends with a formal declaration of peace. Hrotingmen, for instance, will sometimes arrive in the isles,
    spread chaos, and then withdraw their Forces as quickly as they arrived. Often though, when one Side has leverage of
    some kind over the other (such as a Front directly on top of their capital, or a kidnapped nobleman, or a trade
    route hostage, etc.), peace will be negotiated. Either side may call for Peace by placing one Force in the other
    Side's hand. If they accept, and return one Force, then during the Story Phase there is a scene where the two sides
    meet and negotiate concessions.
    Some concessions include:
    Return a surrendered Commander.
    Surrender an Isle or piece of territory.
    Provide Force to serve in the enemy's army.
    Provide an important individual to live in the enemy court.
    Remove all military presence from this land.
    Recognize the enemy as the true ruler of this land.
    Gift the enemy with some valuable resource.
    Forgive a debt owed to the enemy.
    Pledge to aid the enemy in the future.
    Any side may reject a peace treaty and demand further negotiations. If rejected, peace cannot be proposed again
    until next month. Frequently, there will be no clear winner of a war, and both sides must make concessions.
    Sometimes a side may insist upon certain concessions as a matter of revenge, or perhaps under the belief that such a
    concession will ensure no war of this nature comes to this land again. If the leader was forced to surrender, then
    they must still sign a peace treaty, but the terms will be entirely invented and negotiated by the enemy.
    Once a peace treaty is negotiated, work with the Celestial Audience to determine its Impact in Isha.
    War is a State of Mind
    Even if one side gives up or acquiesces to the demands of the other, the Fronts established continue to rage. Chains
    of command are ineffectual and unclear, and an army abandoned in the mountains of Isha will cheerfully turn towards
    banditry and piracy. Even once all sides agree the war is over, Force must still be applied each month to move the
    Fronts out of the Domains and restore Isha to a state of peace.
    War Outside Isha
    If Isha goes to war with a foreign power and sends their armies outside the archipelago, consult with the
    Wilds-Keeper on their Atlas of Faraway Lands (page XX of the Mariner's Codex) and establish Fronts within that. Each
    of these Fronts must be supported — in order to place Force on a Front so far away from Isha, it will cost one Force
    for each Step on the Journey, unless that Force can be obtained from a foreign power.
    Wizards At War
    Wizards may Spend Time to contribute two Force to the War effort through the resources of their Sanctum and their
    Companions. A Wizard may also use their Star upon any Front to enter into a Large-Scale Combat, and play out the
    battle which occurs there. This Battle can create a huge Impact if won, destroying Bastions and Fronts or even
    forcing an entire overcommitted side to surrender.
    If a Wizard possesses an army, perhaps rallied from the peasantry or conjured through some strange magic, it
    contributes between one and five Force to his side in the war, at the discretion of the Celestial Audience.
    In war, it will be especially tempting for a Wizard to take an outsized role in its resolution — perhaps to create a
    storm which destroys all of an empire's armies, or leave a king dead before he can blink. It is good for all Wizards
    to remember there is a reason the Seven-Part Pact was established in the first place, and why Wizards no longer
    command armies the way they did during the Tragedies.
    Part V: The Court's Secrets
    The Ishanian Legal System
    The laws of Isha (much like the laws of any nation) are fickly, arbitrary things, selectively enforced against
    different people based on the power and approval of the ruling powers. While a peasant can expect to be punished for
    the violation of any of these laws, a powerful noble can act without fear of consequence, as long as he stays on the
    good side of the King.
    Who Upholds The Law
    In the Blue City, and within the Palace, the law is enforced by the King's Guard, led by the Magistrate.
    Across the Halcyon Isles, in many smaller Isles, and in rural Isha, the law is enforced by the ruling Clan's Guard.
    These guards often are more concerned with trespassing and crimes against the ruling Clan, and will sometimes act
    against the King's interest in favor of their Clan. Sacred Tahv is protected by the militarized Servants of the
    Flame.
    The Free Duchy of Thyr and Scuttleport both have their own legal system outside Isha (despite the King's most
    valiant attempts otherwise). In the Free Duchy, the Duke's Guard function similarly to the King's own, while in
    Scuttleport the goons of the Pirate Lords are unpredictable and uninterested in maintaining peace.
    Certain isles (such as the Graven Isle, Spyrholm, the Starlit Atoll, or the Orrery) have no one present to enforce
    the law, although crimes committed upon them would theoretically be under the King's purview, and would be tried in
    Ishana if arrested.
    Who Follows The Law
    Peasants, Merchants, and Artisans would be held to the full letter of the law, and if convicted would face heavy
    fines, dismemberment, or death. Soldiers will face much lighter sentences in civilian trials.
    Servants of the Immortal Flame (such as monks or priests) are technically held to the same laws, but in practice the
    Temples have historically protected criminals within their ranks and ensured they get lighter sentences.
    Nobles can expect the legal system to be much lighter on them than it is on others. If the Noble is of the Ascendant
    Allegiance, they're effectively above the law entirely, while if they're of a Frail Allegiance, they're most likely
    just as vulnerable as a peasant.
    Crimes committed against anyone designated an Outlaw won't be prosecuted.
    Where Wizards fall in this system depend tremendously on the authority and respect of the Pact in any particular
    Age, and the willingness of the King and his guards to arrest and try a Wizard. Wizards avoid the civilian legal
    system if at all possible, and will often close ranks to protect one of their own from arrest, preferring to try
    them within the Pact.
    Crimes in Isha
    While what is or isn't legal can vary tremendously based on the stances of the King. The following are all actions
    which are frequently extremely illegal, and are also likely for Wizards to (accidentally or intentionally) violate
    through the use of magic:
    Adultery, polyamory, or annulment of marriage.
    Arson or the destruction of another's property.
    Cross-dressing, impersonation, or forgery.
    Libel, perjury, or blasphemy.
    Murder, battery, or manslaughter (outside of a Duel).
    Poaching from the King's waters or the King's woods, or the chateau of any Clan.
    Robbery, theft, and vagrancy.
    Sodomy.
    Tax evasion, smuggling, avoiding tariffs.
    Treason, fermenting rebellion, spying for a foreign authority.
    Witchcraft, or other magic not permitted by the Pact.
    Update this list further as the King outlaws or permits various actions.
    Inheritance in Isha
    Traditional Line of Inheritance
    In theory, inheritance is intensely patriarchal, and follows an absolute primogeniture system. The eldest son of the
    King will become the next king, followed by any younger sons. If the King has no sons, the title will pass to his
    younger brother, and if he has no siblings, the title will pass to a male relative of his father.
    In practice, the King appoints whoever he trusts to serve as the next king, and upon his death this individual
    strongarms their way onto the throne, keeping other forces in check. While this is normally his eldest son, it's not
    unheard of for the King of Isha to appoint another family member to take the crown instead, if none of his sons are
    worthy.
    Coronation of the New King
    The death of the king is a tragic event, a major moment of upheaval within the archipelago. Its occurrence will
    certainly create complications for the other wizards, and it threatens to destabilize the kingdom. A smooth
    transferral of power is necessary to keep the system of power operational and the Pact in coherence. The pact will
    fall without the authority of the state it is intertwined with.
    If the King has an Heir, then the transference of power is easy. The previous Heir becomes the new King, and the
    Celestial Audience chooses the wizard this person was closest to — that Wizard is in charge of reorganizing the
    court. The Warlock picks a new sun, moon, and rising to represent the personality of this new King, and after the
    funeral, a festival is held in his honor.
    Whenever the King dies, there are many who would claim a right to the throne. His eldest son, his dowager wife, his
    brother; all might fashion themselves the rightful heirs to the throne. If there is a clear heir, then they will
    grumble but step aside (although their agendas may change in the new court to reflect their desires). If there isn't
    a clear heir, then they will launch active attempts to claim the throne, and Civil War will break out across Isha.
    Each different Allegiance within the King's Inner Circle establishes a Front and a Side (from the Rules For War on
    page XX).
    When A Wizard Becomes King
    While it would certainly be a violation of Pact-Law for any other Wizard to become the King of Isha, there is no
    specific language against the Warlock becoming King. In that event, the Warlock must build his court and construct
    his zodiac just as he would any other inheritance, and when the zodiac prompts him to listen to his inner circle, he
    must do so and spend time enacting their agendas. While the title of king may offer many benedictions, it is also a
    heavy burden, and such a Warlock would soon find himself with many masters, and many new obligations beyond what he
    might be used to, for he is now partially at the whims of the stars themselves.
    When The Warlock Does Not Stand Within The Court
    During civil wars (where they may be multiple Courts), or in the event the Warlock is disposed of, there may be
    moments when the Warlock himself is not a member of the court. He may still influence the Court (as any Wizard may),
    but he is considered to have lost control of his Domain and must regain it. Every month, ask the Chain-Keeper to
    create a new Complication for that Court, representing your inability to keep it steady. You may join that Court
    through establishing yourself as a new Servant there, if the King would allow you to rejoin. In the eyes of the
    Pact, a King who does not trust the Warlock is illegitimate and must be replaced, or if such a task is impossible,
    the Warlock himself has failed his Domain.
    The Noble Clans
    Unlike in a traditional feudal system, Isha lacks enough defensible land to justify the formation of social
    authority around land ownership. Instead, Isha's nobility seize power over specific industries, claiming status
    within the gentry as a member of one of its many Clans. Each Clan is composed of multiple families woven together
    into a single political entity through marriage and manipulation, arms its own standing military, is led by its
    elders, and possesses multiple estates across the archipelago.
    There are other Clans in Isha, of varying degrees of power and authority. To create a new one, simply decide on its
    name, its estate, the portion of the economy it controls, and its animal symbol.
    The Croft Clan
    Whenever you Spend Time meeting with Clan Croft, you may also change or add to its Lore.
    The Crofts are the most populous clan in Isha, composed of nearly twenty families working together to maintain
    power, and with their wealth combined claim at least partial ownership of nearly three-fourths of all arable land in
    Isha.
    The Crofts fashion themselves as generous saviors of the common man, supporting rural Isha when food is scarce.
    Among the farmers of Isha, the Crofts have a reputation somewhere between landlords and rakes, as younger Crofts
    will be sent to harass farmers who can't afford to pay their dues.
    The Crofts are led by a council of elders (each titled Thane), who gather in a massive estate along the chalk cliffs
    called the Homestead. Each Thane returns then to his familial estate, which dominates over the small town built
    around it.
    The symbol of the Croft Clan is a powerful ox, with specific variations representing each family, and is the
    centerpiece of many parades in the clan's honor.
    The Uroch Clan
    Whenever you Spend Time meeting with Clan Uroch, you may also change or add to its Lore.
    The Urochi are amongst the most respected clans, composed of a recent union between two families. The clan involves
    itself in every step of mining, quarrying, construction, and smithing.
    The Uroch fashion themselves strong sculptors and masons, building the monumental works of Isha and carving its
    legacy. Among the craftsmen of Isha, the Urochi function as a trade guild, representing their interests politically
    but charging hefty dues for their iconography and legitimacy.
    Clan Uroch is led by a patriarch, titled Duke-Warden, who rules either from his sturdy castle in the Halcyon Isles,
    or from the offices of the stonemason's guild, in the heart of the Blue City.
    The symbol of the Uroch Clan is a stylized crab, which is used as a stamp on pieces of silver or at the foot of old
    buildings to indicate their authenticity and worth.
    The Lark Clan
    Whenever you Spend Time meeting with Clan Lark, you may also change or add to its Lore.
    The Lark Clan is amongst the oldest clans, founded by the mudlark families who would dive beneath the waves to
    collect treasures from the ruined towers on Isha's sea floor.
    The Larks fashion themselves guardians against piracy and eccentric treasure hunters. To the fishermen of Isha,
    they're seen as a necessary evil — they keep the pirates at bay and grant access to the secrets of the deep, but
    their tithes are almost as high as the pirates would steal.
    Clan Lark is led by a matriarch, titled Passerine, who rules from a partially-submerged estate built in the ruins of
    an excavated wizard's tower, on a remote island on the far side of the Bay of Ishana.
    The symbol of the Lark Clan is a bird's wing, and is a common motif on many ship's sails to prove to the Lark's army
    that they have paid their dues and deserve protection.
    The Caravel Clan
    Whenever you Spend Time meeting with Clan Caravel, you may also change or add to its Lore.
    The Caravel Clan is the most sacred and powerful clan in Isha, for they are the inheritors of the sacred art of
    shipwrighting, and maintain the finest groves in the Halcyon Isles, whose only function is to prepare the most
    perfectly-constructed ships.
    The Caravels fashion themselves noble craftsmen of a near-forgotten artistry, of wizards in their own right whose
    magic is to bring life to dead wood and tie the isles together. To many in Isha they are a relic of a bygone age,
    their power more from their political machinations than from their work.
    Clan Caravel is led by a patriarch, titled Grandmaster, whose chateau is surrounded by old-growth forest in a far
    corner of the Halcyon Isles, and whose feasting hall is so large that massive galleys from centuries past are
    suspended overhead.
    The symbol of the Caravel Clan is a dragon, and it is illegal for any Ishanian-born captain to lead a ship without
    that authorized sigil carved somewhere on its hull.
    The Oshrani Clan
    Whenever you Spend Time meeting with Clan Oshrani, you may also change or add to its Lore.
    Clan Oshrani was once a noble household in the great city of Ur, before they were deposed and forced to flee as the
    empire grew in power. Settling in Isha they put their finances to good use, becoming by far the wealthiest clan in
    the archipelago.
    The Oshrani fashion themselves decadent patrons of the fine arts and financiers of the King's splendor. In truth,
    the Five Banking Halls of the Oshrani use their finances to apply pressure to clans who work against them and
    control the debts of the King.
    The Oshrani are led by a patriarch, titled Dauphin, who holds court of his own within the glorious expense of the
    clan's chateau in the Halcyon Isles, a beautiful modern monument to wealth composed mostly of glass and
    intricately-woven and extremely fragile gold.
    The symbol of the Oshrani is a two-headed sphinx, which can be found on the back of every single Ishanian coin,
    tucked beneath the king's own sigil.
    The Wain Clan
    Whenever you Spend Time meeting with Clan Wain, you may also change or add to its Lore.
    Clan Wain is the most mysterious of the nobility, with countless rumors swirling around their foundation, with some
    claiming they were founded by a cult who cheated death itself. The clan itself only encourages the rumors, lending
    an air of mystique to the family.
    The Wain fashion themselves the sin-eaters of Isha, who carry the dead and dying to the Graven Isle and who perform
    surgery on the injured. The truth is an open secret: many in their ranks practice ghoul-calling and other illegal
    magics, and make their true fortune on smuggling occult treatises and reagents through their Auction House.
    The Wain Clan are supposedly led by a patriarch, titled Most Gracious, although some suspect the true seat of power
    lies in Scuttleport, where their gloomy estate looms over the miserable slums.
    The symbol of the Wain is a mangy dog, which they fly upon their black ships to warn other sailors of the dead they
    ferry to the Graven Isle.
    The Ix Clan
    Whenever you Spend Time meeting with Clan Ix, you may also change or add to its Lore.
    Clan Ix is the most established family in Isha, capable of tracing their lineage back five hundred years before the
    Tragedies, and who are said to have been founded by the inventor of the twin writing systems used by Isha to this
    day.
    Ixians fashion themselves the great history-keepers of Isha, the authors of its past and the architects of its
    future. The common folk fear them as lawyers, bureaucrats, and authoritarian busybodies who inflate the ranks of the
    University, but who are valuable when literacy is needed.
    The Ix Clan is led by a patriarch, titled Lord Pursuivant, who keeps track of the sprawling and convoluted lineage
    of Ishanian nobility upon an enormous arboreal mural painted on the side of the ancient estate.
    The symbol of the Ix is a gulabi goat, and the sacred herds of this animal are bred by the Ix's servants within the
    Halcyon Isles for their exquisite vellum.
    Foreign Powers
    Isha is not the only country in the Faraway Sea — powerful forces plot and scheme against the Halcyon King,
    separated by vast oceans and great barriers of culture and faith. These Foreign Powers can be wildly dangerous or
    exceptionally useful, and sometimes both at once.
    The Free Duchy of Far Reach
    Whenever you Spend Time learning about the Free Duchy of Far Reach, you may also change or add to its Lore.
    The Far Reach is a series of small islands to the northwest of the archipelago, historically administered by the
    Kingdom of Isha. Four generations ago, they declared independence, and after a protracted war, won their freedom.
    The Far Reach maintains its independence through shrewd financial negotiations and a willingness to trade with
    anyone, and its ports present an alternative for merchants traveling westward without needing to pay Ishanian
    tithes. They've been a longstanding thorn in Isha's side, and their destruction would represent a huge increase in
    trade for the archipelago.
    The Free Duchy is ruled by the Archduke Thyr III, a boisterous nobleman, a powerful potential ally, and an eligible
    bachelor. His wealth comes from the purple dye extracted by his people, a rare luxury.
    The Pirate-Lords of Scuttleport
    Whenever you Spend Time learning about the Pirate-Lords of Scuttleport, you may also change or add to its Lore.
    While the Kingdom of Isha claims dominion over the wretched city of Scuttleport, everyone knows the truth: the city
    is run as its own independent city-state, controlled by the machinations of criminals and entirely outside Isha's
    law.
    Scuttleport serves as a hideaway for smugglers and bandits, giving them access to Isha's oceans and an easy place to
    hide and lay low. Attempts to crack down on Scuttleport's crime has turned into outright war.
    While there is never any one Pirate-Lord who can hold onto power for long, anyone who could find a way to wrangle
    them together (or even bring them back into Isha) would have access to a tremendous fleet, a great deal of (mostly
    stolen) wealth, and a lot of illegal magic.
    The Triarchy of Ur
    Whenever you Spend Time learning about the Triarchy of Ur, you may also change or add to its Lore.
    The Triarchy of Ur rules over much of the known world, an ancient empire based out of the sprawling megalopolis of
    Ur, so enormous it must be divided amongst three emperors (who are corrupt, childish, and rotting away, in turn).
    Ur has, at various points, attempted to seize control of Isha and turn its magic towards their own ends. The
    Bone-Priests of Ur are jealous of Ishanian magic, and desire nothing more than to reclaim their lost glory.
    While Ur is a dying empire, they are not dead yet — a thousand different armies march under their banners, and their
    emperors can procure wealth beyond any's wildest dreams. If one could wrangle the full attention of Ur towards a
    single objective, then nothing could stand in its way.
    Elpenor's Kingdom
    Whenever you Spend Time learning about Elpenor's Kingdom, you may also change or add to its Lore.
    The Hecares Archipelago are a small southern nation, not dissimilar from Isha, which was conquered by Ur long ago.
    The boy-king Elpenor recently beat back the Urite armies and declared both his independence and his intent at
    expanding his kingdom northward.
    While Elpenor's greatest foe is Ur, he has no lost love for wizards, for he blames magic for the death of his
    mother. Elpenor's oracles and advisors whisper in his ear even now encouraging him to seize Isha's power to aid in
    his expansion.
    Elpenor's Kingdom is new and ambitious, rapidly expanding across a large amount of territory and carving a name for
    itself in the history books. An alliance with Elpenor could give Isha access to this newfound power, and ensure its
    survival against Ur's inevitable wrath.
    The Hrotingmen
    Whenever you Spend Time learning about the Hrotingmen, you may also change or add to its Lore.
    The Hrotingmen come from a land of ice and snow far to the north, where they worship god-corpses and serve cruel
    witches, to raid and pillage Isha, dragging the archipelago's wealth back to their homes as bounty.
    The Hrotingmen are Isha's longest enemy, whose Jarls have delighted in its torment and when united enough to launch
    an attack, have nearly torched the kingdom to the ground.
    An alliance with the Hrotingmen is both fickle and irresponsible, for they are warriors above all else, and lack any
    other culture. But their violence could be a valuable tool, if one could use it.
    The Druj-Lands
    Whenever you Spend Time learning about the Hrotingmen, you may also change or add to its Lore.
    The Drujmen are from a faraway land, poisoned by old necromancy that seeped into their bones. Now they cannot die,
    and they dwell in spider-fortresses wearing the mockeries of life and dreaming of stealing the truth of death.
    The Drujites blame Wizards for their state, and many Necromancers have taken it upon themselves to travel West to
    eradicate these abominations of life, leading to miserable and haunting war.
    The Druj-Lands are the home to many forgotten relics from the Tragedies, as well as occult tomes holding twisted
    secrets of old magic. Obtaining these resources could make an alliance with the Druj worth tolerating.
    Other Foreign Powers
    There are countless smaller governments, churches, banks, and other powerful entities across the Faraway Sea, each
    seeking to grow their power and influence Isha in their own way. Whenever you encounter or discover another Foreign
    Power, add it to this list, or Spend Time to develop and flesh out the Lore of any of these powers.
    The Eofmark Marches, a dismal western kingdom who also worships the Immortal Flame and who is beleaguered by the
    Druj.
    The Wyvern-Ports of Edalisk, a powerful port-city whose wyvern-riders are the terror of pirates across the southern
    sea.
    The Golden Eye Company, a famous and powerful mercenary company who has fought both for and against the Triarchy of
    Ur.
    The Ashen Bank, the wealthiest financers in the Faraway Sea, and whose armies ensure that all debts are inevitably
    repaid.
    Church of the Three-Eyed God, a cult spreading to the East, whose witch-queens wield substantial political authority
    within Ur.
    Mulfeldir, a monstrous traitor dragon whose devoted servants war against the Hrotingmen for sacrifices.
    The Seven Golden Cities, a series of isolationist and fabulously wealthy city-states far to the south, who are said
    to adorn their walls in gold and silver, and feast on every spice known to man.
    Part VI: Inheriting The Iron Throne
    Eventually, the Warlock will die. It is inevitable — all Wizards die, when given enough time. It's practically the
    only thing they all have in common. The Warlock will die, and a new Warlock will take his place.
    There is a great burden on your shoulders. I hope you are prepared to carry it.
    This Part of The Book of Thrones is exclusively reserved for the Warlock's successor. It contains instructions on
    how to create a new Warlock when you're not the first Warlock within this iteration of The Seven-Part Pact.
    The New Warlock
    Complete Humour & Temperament as is traditional.
    Choose your origins, before you became Warlock:
    You were the old Warlock's Prentice, his child, or one of his other Companions. Continue without interruption.
    You were a noble from one of Isha's Clans, chosen by the King for political reasons. Change the Lore of your Clan.
    You may move one of the Servants of your Clan for free each month, without having to Spend Time.
    You were one of the King's own children, granted the title due to nepotism. You don't have to Spend Time to remain
    in the King's Inner Circle.
    You were someone else, who another Wizard mentored and prepared for this position. Ask that Wizard for a Treasure or
    other boon representing your relationship.
    Complete History & Secrets, and Might & Trappings. For Treasures, you have all the Treasures possessed by the old
    Warlock, and an additional one which he didn't choose. You cannot possess any Treasures which have been destroyed.
    The Keep & His Companions
    Consult the Lore of the Halcyon Isles, the Warlock's Keep, and any sketches of the Map. If you aren't one of the old
    Warlock's Companions, ask the Celestial Audience to add new Lore to both reflecting how their unfamiliarity and
    discomfort for you.
    Choose Companions. Keep as many of the old Warlock's Companions as is applicable, although they cannot provide the
    same Care for you which they provided the old Warlock.
    The Court of the King
    Familiarize yourself with the King, his zodiac, and the structure of his Court. You cannot change the Laws of the
    Court.
    If you are the old Warlock's Prentice, or if the Warlock's Prentice remained one of your Companions, then the Court
    is stable. You can adjust the position of up to three Servants before starting.
    If you're not the old Warlock's Prentice, the Court remains exactly how it was, push everyone in the Court back in
    Standing as the King grows wary without guidance.
    Throne-Keeper's Secrets
    Familiarize yourself with the responsibilities of the Throne-Keeper and the state of the Lore of the Faith in Parts
    IV and V. Ensure you observe any changes the old Warlock made to the Clans and Foreign Powers.
    Describe for the table your new Warlock, and coronate yourself upon your Throne of Iron.
